# Optimization and Reinforcement Learning for Pricing and Inventory Management

This document outlines two approaches to solving a pricing and inventory management problem: an optimization framework and a reinforcement learning framework.

## Optimization Approach

### Problem Formulation

Given a reference price \( p_0 \), forecasted quantities \( q_i \) for the next \( n \) days, and a regression coefficient \( r \), the goal is to maximize total revenue \( V \) subject to certain constraints.

**Variables and Constants:**

- \( p_i \): Price on day \( i \).
- \( p_0 \): Reference price at time \( t_0 \).
- \( q_i \): Forecasted quantity for day \( i \) based on \( p_0 \).
- \( q'_i \): Adjusted forecasted quantity for day \( i \).
- \( r \): Regression coefficient for % rebate to quantity.
- \( s_i \): Stock level at the end of day \( i \).
- \( a_i \): Stock arriving on day \( i \).
- \( c \): Minimum stock constant.

**Objective:**

Maximize total revenue:

\[ \text{Maximize } V = \sum_{i=1}^{n} q'_i p_i \]

**Constraints:**

1. Price constraints: \( 0.8p_0 \leq p_i \leq 1.2p_0 \) for all \( i \).
2. Stock constraints: \( s_i \geq c \) for all \( i \).

### Model Equations

1. Adjusted forecasted quantity:

\[ q'_i = q_i + r \left( \frac{p_i - p_0}{p_0} \right) \]

2. Stock level update:

\[ s_i = s_{i-1} - q'_i + a_i \]

## Reinforcement Learning Approach

### Framework

Reinforcement learning (RL) can be applied to this problem, with the following components:

- **Environment**: Market dynamics.
- **Agent**: System deciding daily prices.
- **Actions**: Set of possible prices for each day.
- **State**: Information like stock levels, historical prices, and demand forecasts.
- **Rewards**: Daily revenue or a function considering revenue and stock levels.
- **Policy**: Strategy for setting prices based on the current state.

### Learning Process

The agent learns optimal pricing strategies through trial and error, balancing exploration (trying new strategies) and exploitation (using known successful strategies).

### Considerations

RL requires a well-designed environment model, suitable reward structure, and often substantial data for training. It is powerful for handling uncertainties and changing market conditions.
